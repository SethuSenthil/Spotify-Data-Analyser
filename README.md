# Spotify-Data-Analyser
 Analyse Spotify Takeout Data

## Instructions
- Download your data from Spotify Takeout
- Drop it into the Data folder
  - If you have multiple takeouts name them "My Data 2,3, etc" (the higher the number, the more recent it is)
- Run npm start (no need for npm install since it requires no dependencies)
  - This will compile and arrange all of your data into one main.json file
- Open the index.html
